# something

I'm having a difficult time comprehending why me from a year ago decided it was necessary to push this to github.

The only reason I can think of is to try and have it easily accessible from any location, but if I wanted to
transfer the code from one device to another I could have used a dozen other options. Cloud, flashdrive, google drive, etc.
